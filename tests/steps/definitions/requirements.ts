 * 2. Essential Commands
 * 
 * Docker Setup:
 * ```bash
 * # Build containers
 * ./docker/build.ps1
 * 
 * # Start application
 * ./docker/start.ps1
 * 
 * # Configure application
 * ./docker/config.ps1
 * 
 * # Stop containers
 * ./docker/stop.ps1
 * ```
 * 
 * Running Tests:
 * ```bash
 * # Install dependencies
 * npm install
 * 
 * # Install Playwright browsers
 * npx playwright install
 * 
 * # Run Playwright tests
 * npm run test:e2e
 * 
 * # Run Cucumber tests

 * 
 * Application URLs:
 * - Main App: http://localhost:8000
 * - MailHog: http://localhost:8001
 * - PHPMyAdmin: http://localhost:8002
 * 
 * Default Admin Credentials:

 */

/**
 * 4. Test Implementation Details
 * 
 * BDD Tests (Cucumber):
 * - Features written in Gherkin syntax
 * - Step definitions using Playwright for automation
 * - Shared world.ts for browser context
 * 
 * E2E Tests (Playwright):
 * - Page Object Model pattern
 * - Shared fixtures for common scenarios
 * - Automatic screenshot and video capture on failure
 * 
 * CI/CD (GitHub Actions):
 * - Automatic test runs on PRs and main branch
 * - Parallel service containers
 * - Test artifacts preservation
 */

/**
 * 5. Key Files and Their Purposes
 * 
 * playwright.config.ts:
 * - Browser configuration
 * - Test timeouts and retries
 * - Reporter settings
 * 
 * .github/workflows/test.yml:
 * - CI/CD pipeline configuration
 * - Test execution environment
 * - Artifact handling
 * 
 * fixtures.ts:
 * - Shared test utilities
 * - User credentials
 * - Common test setup
 */

/**
 * 6. Test Coverage Areas
 * 
 * Authentication:
 * - Login validation
 * - Invalid credentials handling
 * - Protected route access
 * 
 * Tour Booking:
 * - Available tours listing
 * - Booking process
 * - Price calculation
 * - Ticket generation
 * 
 * Admin Features:
 * - Tour management
 * - Booking overview
 * - Ticket management
 */

/**
 * 7. Best Practices Implemented
 * 
 * Code Organization:
 * - Separation of concerns (features, steps, e2e tests)
 * - Reusable fixtures and utilities
 * - Clear naming conventions
 * 
 * Test Design:
 * - Independent test cases
 * - Proper setup and teardown
 * - Meaningful assertions
 * 
 * CI/CD:
 * - Automated test execution
 * - Test result reporting
 * - Environment consistency
 */

/**
 * 8. Common Issues and Solutions
 * 
 * 1. PowerShell Script Execution:
 *    Issue: "Running scripts is disabled on this system"
 *    Solution: Run with bypass flag
 *    ```powershell
 *    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\script.ps1
 *    ```
 * 
 * 2. Docker Container Access:
 *    Issue: Services not immediately available
 *    Solution: Added health checks and wait time in CI
 * 
 * 3. Test Flakiness:
 *    Issue: Inconsistent test results
 *    Solution: 
 *    - Added proper wait conditions
 *    - Implemented retry logic
 *    - Enhanced error screenshots
 */

/**
 * 9. Future Improvements
 * 
 * 1. Test Coverage:
 *    - Add API testing layer
 *    - Implement visual regression tests
 *    - Add performance testing
 * 
 * 2. Infrastructure:
 *    - Add test parallelization
 *    - Implement test data management
 *    - Add cross-browser testing
 * 
 * 3. Reporting:
 *    - Enhanced test analytics
 *    - Integration with test management tools
 *    - Custom report dashboards
